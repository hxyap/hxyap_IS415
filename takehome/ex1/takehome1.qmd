# Introduction: Armed Conflict in Myanmar

Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is a country in Southeast Asia with a rich cultural heritage and a complex, often troubled modern history. With a population of about 54 million people and over 135 distinct ethnic groups, Myanmar is a tapestry of diverse cultures, languages, and traditions. However, this diversity has also been a source of long-standing tensions and conflicts.

## Historical Context

Since gaining independence from British rule in 1948, Myanmar has grappled with numerous internal conflicts. For decades, the country was under military rule, which ended officially in 2011 with a transition to a quasi-civilian government. However, in February 2021, the military (Tatmadaw) seized power again in a coup, plunging the country back into political turmoil and reigniting many dormant conflicts.

## Key Factors in Myanmar's Conflicts

Our analysis of armed conflict in Myanmar focuses on three primary factors that have historically been, and continue to be, major drivers of instability:

1\. **Religious Tensions**: Myanmar is predominantly Buddhist, but with significant Muslim, Christian, and animist minorities. Religious tensions, particularly between Buddhists and Muslims, have led to violent conflicts, most notably the persecution of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine State.

2\. **Ethnic Tensions**: The country's ethnic diversity has been a source of both cultural richness and conflict. Many ethnic minority groups, particularly in border areas, have long sought greater autonomy or independence from the central government dominated by the Bamar majority. These tensions have resulted in some of the world's longest-running civil wars.

3\. **Drug Trade and Infrastructure Development**: Myanmar is part of the Golden Triangle, one of the world's largest drug-producing regions. The drug trade, particularly methamphetamine and opium, has fueled conflicts and corrupted institutions. Simultaneously, infrastructure development projects, often involving foreign investment, have sometimes exacerbated local tensions over land rights and resource allocation.

## Purpose of the Analysis

Given this complex backdrop, our geospatial analysis of armed conflict in Myanmar aims to:

1\. Identify patterns and hotspots of armed conflict.

2\. Examine how these factors interact and potentially exacerbate each other in different regions of the country.

3\. Track changes in conflict patterns over time, particularly in relation to significant political events like the 2021 military coup.

By focusing on these aspects, we hope to provide valuable insights that can inform humanitarian responses, contribute to a better understanding of conflict dynamics, and assist in developing more effective strategies for peace-building and development in the region.

We first begin by using read_csv to read our aspatial csv data into our sf frame.

```{r}
acled_sf <- read_csv("data/ACLED_Myanmar.csv") %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
           crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 32647) %>%
  mutate(event_date = dmy(event_date))
```

Now that we've load the sf, let's check if our boundary for Myanmar works:

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
acled_sf %>%
  filter(year == 2023 |
           event_type == "Political violence") %>%
  tm_shape() +
  tm_dots()
```

We'll next use glimpse so we know what aspects of the data we can work around to try to glean more insights about the Myanmar crisis.

```{r}
glimpse(acled_sf)
```

For later analysis, we'll also be using the regional boundaries as well, so I've conveniently placed this chunk below to load our regional boundaries.

Let's load our boundary:

```{r}
myanmar_boundary_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/mmr_polbnda_adm0_250k_mimu_1", 
                layer = "mmr_polbnda_adm0_250k_mimu_1")
```

# Compare CRS

Since we've gotten our data from different sources, let's find out if they follow Myanmar's crs system to ensure consistency for our analysis!

```{r}
# Check CRS of acled_sf
#print("CRS of ACLED data:")
# print(st_crs(acled_sf))
# WGS84
```

Hmm... this might differ from the boundaries of the Myanmar boundary. Let's do a quick st_transform to change the CRS used.

```{r}
# Transform Myanmar boundary to match ACLED data CRS
myanmar_boundary_sf <- st_transform(myanmar_boundary_sf, st_crs(acled_sf))
# Unite all geometries
myanmar_boundary_sf <- st_union(myanmar_boundary_sf)

# Remove Z or M dimensions
myanmar_boundary_sf <- st_zm(myanmar_boundary_sf, drop = TRUE, what = "ZM")

# print(st_crs(myanmar_boundary_sf))
```

Now that our data is formatted in the same way, we can start slowly plotting our boundary to do our initial analysis of the conflict!

```{r}
# Create a simple plot of the Myanmar boundary
tm_shape(myanmar_boundary_sf) +
  tm_borders(col = "blue", lwd = 2) +
  tm_fill(col = "lightblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(title = "Myanmar Boundary",
            title.size = 1.2,
            title.position = c("center", "top"))
```

Let's check if our event types exist as defined:

Here we check for unique events to ensure we are capturing the correct event types:

```{r}
unique_event_types <- unique(acled_sf$event_type)
print("Unique event types in the dataset:")
print(unique_event_types)
```

Sweet! looks good! Let's filter out now for our wanted event types!

```{r}

# Filter ACLED data for the specified date range and event types
event_types <- c("Battles", "Explosions/Remote violence", "Strategic developments", "Violence against civilians")
acled_filtered <- acled_sf %>%
  filter(event_date >= as.Date("2021-01-01") & event_date <= as.Date("2024-06-30"),
         event_type %in% event_types) %>%
  mutate(quarter = paste0(year(event_date), "_Q", quarter(event_date)))
```

# Defining our KDE function, and ppp

To gain a better understanding of where we should look at to find the hotspot of the conflict, we should use KDE here to visualize the "hot-cold" spots on the map, where redder points have more conflict and "colder" bluer points have less. Furthermore, KDE also smoothes out the data, making it easier to visualize on the map where we should pay attention to.

We'll first convert to ppp (planar point pattern) so we can do use it for our KDE analysis.

```{r}
# Create window for ppp objects
myanmar_window <- as.owin(myanmar_boundary_sf)
```

Here, we create the quarter column in order to break down the conflict into distinct time bounded quarters. This will come in handy later should we choose to do snapshots at every quarter to visualize how conflict has evolved in Myanmar over time, as well as facilitating temporal analysis. Note that we are using numeric quarters here since it makes it easier later on for us to plot spatiotemporal KDE!

```{r}
# Create the Quarter column
acled_filtered$Quarter <- paste0(year(acled_filtered$event_date), "_Q", quarter(acled_filtered$event_date))
#numeric (1-12)
acled_filtered$QuarterNumeric <- (year(acled_filtered$event_date) - 2021) * 4 + quarter(acled_filtered$event_date)

# Create a new sf object with only Quarter and geometry
acled_quarter <- st_sf(
  QuarterNumeric = acled_filtered$QuarterNumeric,
  geometry = st_geometry(acled_filtered)
)


```

```{r}
acled_quarter_ppp <- as.ppp(acled_quarter)
```

In order to avoid duplicated data point on the same location messing with our analysis, we separate them via jittering as below:

```{r}
# Apply jittering
acled_q_ppp_jit <- rjitter(acled_quarter_ppp, retry=TRUE, nsim=1, drop=TRUE)

```

```{r}
if (any(duplicated(acled_q_ppp_jit))) {
  warning("Some duplicates remain after jittering")
}
```

Finally, we segragate the data into our previous Myanmar boundary window so we ensure everything can be plotted within the borders of Myanmar.

```{r}
armed_q_owin <- acled_q_ppp_jit[myanmar_window]
summary(armed_q_owin)
```

## Plotting Armed events owin:

```{r}
plot(armed_q_owin)
```

### Plotting stkde for quarterly kde

We now do spatio-temporal KDE here with st_kde as it'll provide the baseline for our later spatio-temporal visualizations.

```{r}
st_kde <- spattemp.density(armed_q_owin)
summary(st_kde)
```

::: callout-note
In my initial run, there were duplicate points. Since ACLED collects from a variety of sources, I have considered the possibility of multiple sources reporting the same event, but for sake of time I have jittered them earlier on. Below, we shall embark on plotting out the graph. Note that I decided on representation as 1-12 since tt only takes in numeric so quarter() from tidyverse would not work well with it...
:::

## Quarterly KDE

Let's now move onto our quarterly KDE analysis, now that our kde and st_kde objects are set up in our environments.

```{r}
kde <- density(armed_q_owin,
                   sigma=bw.diggle,
                   edge=TRUE,
                   kernel="gaussian")
summary(kde)
```

Here, we plot 3 quarters as a time for a compact side-by-side view of progression of conflict from a spatial standpoint.

```{r}

# Function to plot 3 quarters
plot_kde_quarters <- function(start_quarter) {
  quarters <- start_quarter:(start_quarter + 2)
  par(mfrow=c(1,3), mar=c(2,2,2,1))
  
  for(i in quarters) {
    plot(kde, i, 
         override.par=FALSE, 
         fix.range=TRUE, 
         main=paste("KDE (non-spatial) Q", i, "(", floor((i-1)/4 + 2021), "Q", (i-1)%% 4 + 1, ")"),
         ribbon=TRUE)  # Turned ribbon back on for more informative plots
  }
  
  par(mfrow=c(1,1))  # Reset plot layout
}
```

```{r}

# Function to plot 3 quarters
plot_kde_quarters <- function(start_quarter) {
  quarters <- start_quarter:(start_quarter + 2)
  par(mfrow=c(1,3), mar=c(2,2,2,1))
  
  for(i in quarters) {
    plot(kde, i, 
         override.par=FALSE, 
         fix.range=TRUE, 
         main=paste("KDE (non-spatial) Q", i, "(", floor((i-1)/4 + 2021), "Q", (i-1)%% 4 + 1, ")"),
         ribbon=TRUE)  # Turned ribbon back on for more informative plots
  }
  
  par(mfrow=c(1,1))  # Reset plot layout
}
```

We now proceed to plot the non spatial temporal KDEs to visualize the distribution of events without time considered.

```{r}
# Plot four sets of quarters
plot_kde_quarters(1)  # Quarters 1, 2, 3
```

```{r}
plot_kde_quarters(4)  # Quarters 4,5,6

```

```{r}
plot_kde_quarters(7)  # Quarters 7,8,9
```

```{r}
plot_kde_quarters(10) # Quarters 10,11,12
```

As we can see, there are some pin points of conflict in the central regions and south region of Myanmar, but nothing really conclusive. Thus, we fall back onto our spatio-temporal KDE for detailed analysis of the conflict. Let's dive in!

## Quarterly spatiotemporal KDE

This function ahead will help us chunk down and plot 3 side-by-side quarters:

```{r}
# Function to plot 3 quarters
plot_quarters <- function(start_quarter) {
  quarters <- start_quarter:(start_quarter + 2)
  par(mfrow=c(1,3), mar=c(2,2,2,1))
  
  for(i in quarters) {
    plot(st_kde, i, 
         override.par=FALSE, 
         fix.range=TRUE, 
         main=paste("KDE Q", i, "(", floor((i-1)/4 + 2021), "Q", (i-1)%% 4 + 1, ")"),
         ribbon=TRUE)  # Turned ribbon back on for more informative plots
  }
  
  par(mfrow=c(1,1))  # Reset plot layout
}
```

```{r}
# Plot four sets of quarters
plot_quarters(1)  # Quarters 1, 2, 3
```

```{r}
plot_quarters(4)  # Quarters 4, 5, 6
```

```{r}
plot_quarters(7)  # Quarters 7, 8, 9
```

```{r}
plot_quarters(10)  # Quarters 10, 11, 12
```

Wow! It's now much clearer that our thesis of the hotspots being central and maybe south regions of Myanmar looks more viable now. Based on the charts, we can actually point out some interesting trends:

1.  There's been a large hotspot for conflict in central Vietnam, but there has been a sudden migration and flare up in conflict in 2023 Q4, spreading from Central Regions to the east too.

2.  From 2023 Q1 onwards, the conflict really seems to have died down in the south region of Myanmar, with the exception of the sudden outburst again in 2023 Q4.

Peeking outside of our data, we can see that this is probably linked to Operation 1027:

<https://thediplomat.com/2023/10/operation-1027-a-turning-point-for-myanmars-resistance-struggle/>

::: callout-note
### But what is Operation 1027?

Operation 1027 is an ongoing military offensive launched on October 27, 2023, by the Three Brotherhood Alliance (3BTA), which includes the Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). The operation targets the State Administration Council (SAC), Myanmar’s ruling military junta, and aims to capture strategic locations in northern Shan State, near the Myanmar-China border.

# now let's animate this

library(animation)

plot_quarters_gif <- function(output_file = "kde_plot_animation.gif") {
  # Set up the animation
  saveGIF({

      # Plot single quarter
      plot(st_kde, q, 
           override.par = FALSE, 
           fix.range = TRUE, 
           main = paste("KDE Q", q, "(", floor((q-1)/4 + 2021), "Q", (q-1) %% 4 + 1, ")"),
           ribbon = TRUE)

}


gif_path <- plot_quarters_gif()
# print(paste("GIF created at:", gif_path))
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("kde_plot_animation.gif")
```

::: callout-note
As we can see, it seems like above Mandalay and below Sagaing there seems to be a hotspot of armed conflict events, with some initial conflict in Yangon in the earlier quarters. However, there seems to be a flare up in the conflict in the last quarter we have in the dataset. We should now dig deeper with 2nd order analysis in the highlighted areas. We'll look at Mandalay as it's the primary region of the conflict.
:::

## Second order analysis

We'll load the regional shp file now and create an owin for it.

```{r}
regional_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/regional", 
                layer = "mmr_polbnda2_adm1_250k_mimu_1")
```

```{r}
plot(regional_sf)
```

```{r}
# Transform Myanmar boundary to match ACLED data CRS
regional_sf <- st_transform(regional_sf , st_crs(acled_sf))

print(st_crs(regional_sf ))
```

```{r}
# Create window for ppp objects
reg_owin <- as.owin(regional_sf)
```

```{r}
# Redefine the window of the jittered ppp object
armed_r_owin <- acled_q_ppp_jit[reg_owin]
```

```{r}
conflict_r_sf <- st_as_sf(as.data.frame(acled_q_ppp_jit), coords = c("x", "y"), crs = st_crs(regional_sf))

# Create the plot
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = regional_sf, aes(fill = ST), alpha = 0.5) +  # Use ST or any other column for filling
  geom_sf(data = conflict_r_sf, color = "black", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Armed Conflicts in Myanmar",
       fill = "State/Region") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Recalling our hotspot analysis, let's find the hottest region.

::: callout-note
### Note on commented out blocks

Feel free to uncomment the below chunk! For the sake of not exploding my github repo, I've decided to cull memory usage by not running the below chunk, but if you run it, you should probably also see that it is centered by Mandalay :)
:::

```{r}

# Calculate the centroid of all conflict points
# conflict_center <- st_centroid(st_union(conflict_r_sf))

# Convert the centroid to an sf object
# conflict_center_sf <- st_sf(geometry = conflict_center)

# Ensure both objects have the same CRS
# conflict_center_sf <- st_transform(conflict_center_sf, st_crs(regional_sf))

# Perform a spatial join to find which region contains the center point
# center_region <- st_join(conflict_center_sf, regional_sf)

# Extract the region name (assuming the region column is named 'ST' as in your previous code)
# region_name <- center_region$ST

# Print the coordinates
# print(paste("The center of the conflict points is in the region:", region_name))


# print(paste("The center of the conflict points is in the region:", region_name)
 
 
    #      X       Y
# [1,] 190741 2294623
# [1] "The center of the conflict points is in the region: Mandalay"
```

### Mandalay analysis

We'll take a look at Mandalay here since we saw it as "hot" in our initial analysis.

```{r}
# 1. Subset the Mandalay region
Mandalay_sf <- regional_sf[regional_sf$ST == "Mandalay", ]

# 2. Create a window for Mandalay
Mandalay_owin <- as.owin(Mandalay_sf)

# 3. Subset the point pattern to Mandalay
Mandalay_ppp <- acled_q_ppp_jit[Mandalay_owin]

```

```{r}
summary(Mandalay_ppp)
```

We'll convert to km here using rescale, since previously, using the base unit (metres) had issues with plotting the second order functions.

```{r}
Mandalay_ppp_km <- rescale(Mandalay_ppp, 1000, "km")
```

```{r}
plot(Mandalay_ppp_km)

```

We'll first start by using the L function:

::: callout-note
### L-function:

The L function, a variant of Ripley's K function, examines spatial dependence over a range of distances. It measures the number of points within increasing radii from each point, providing insight into patterns at multiple scales simultaneously.
:::

```{r}
L_mw = Lest(Mandalay_ppp_km, correction = "Ripley")
plot(L_mw, . -r ~ r, 
     ylab= "L(d)-r", xlab = "d(m)")
```

```{r}
# L_mw.csr <- envelope(Mandalay_ppp_km, Lest, nsim = 99, rank = 1, glocal=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# plot(L_mw.csr, . - r ~ r, xlab="d", ylab="L(d)-r")
```

Since our function fell outside our envelope, this means there's a significant deviation from the Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR) at various distance scales, providing significant evidence of clustering at those distances. Let's confirm this by backing it up with the G-function:

::: callout-note
### G function

The G function analyzes the distribution of distances to the nearest neighbor for each point in a spatial pattern. It focuses on first-order spatial effects, primarily capturing local, small-scale patterns.
:::

```{r}
G_mw.csr <- envelope(Mandalay_ppp, Gest, nsim = 99)
```

```{r}
plot(G_mw.csr, . - r ~ r, xlab="d", ylab="K(d)-r")
```

Since our observed G function falls within the envelope, it suggests that the nearest neighbor distances in the observed pattern do not significantly differ from what would be expected under CSR at the local, first-order level.

Hmmm... Although the G-function is within our expected envelope, however, our L function is not. What does this mean? I think a reasonable take is that:

-   At the very local scale (nearest neighbors), conflicts appear to be randomly distributed. This suggests no immediate spatial dependency between individual conflict events.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   However, at larger scales, there is significant clustering of conflicts. This indicates that while individual events might not be directly influencing each other's locations, there are broader factors creating areas of higher conflict density.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   This pattern could be explained by the presence of "hot zones" of conflict activity. Within these zones, individual conflicts might occur in seemingly random locations, but the zones themselves represent areas of heightened risk or activity.

Thus, I think the reasonable conclusion here is that even at the region level, perhaps due to the nature of resources/ locations being held by the different actors in the Myanmar civil conflict, the conflicts are "grouped" in hotspots, but within those hotspots, the reported location can vary, which suggests a structure to how either conflicts are reported in the region, or by what locations are important within a region, especially in a hotspot region like the Mandalay region.

# Visualization of Conflict Density Using OpenStreetMap

Now that we've had the basic analysis, let's use OpenStreetMap to let us see in greater detail what's going on. We use get_osm_map to get our basemap from OpenStreetMap, then do some CRS conversion as well as list making/raster conversion to stack our images to present a more nuanced graph!

```{r}

# Function to fetch OpenStreetMap base map
get_osm_map <- function(bbox) {
  osm_map <- read_osm(bbox, type = "osm", zoom = NULL)
  return(osm_map)
}

plot_kde_quarters_tmap <- function(kde, start_quarter) {
  quarters <- start_quarter:(start_quarter + 2)
  
  # Get bounding box from kde object
  bbox_utm <- c(kde$xrange[1], kde$yrange[1], kde$xrange[2], kde$yrange[2])
  
  # Create a SpatialPolygons object for the bounding box
  bbox_sp <- as(extent(bbox_utm), "SpatialPolygons")
  proj4string(bbox_sp) <- CRS("+proj=utm +zone=47 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
  
  # Transform bbox to WGS84
  bbox_wgs84 <- st_as_sf(bbox_sp) %>% st_transform(4326) %>% st_bbox()
  
  # Fetch OpenStreetMap data
  osm_map <- get_osm_map(bbox_wgs84)
  
  # Create a list to store individual plots
  plot_list <- list()
  
  for (i in quarters) {
    # Convert im object to a raster
    r <- raster(kde)
    
    # Set the CRS for the raster
    crs(r) <- CRS("+proj=utm +zone=47 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
    
    # Project raster to WGS84
    r_wgs84 <- projectRaster(r, crs = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
    
    # Create tmap object
    tm <- tm_shape(osm_map) +
      tm_rgb() +
      tm_shape(r_wgs84) +
      tm_raster(palette = "viridis", alpha = 0.6, title = "Density") +
      tm_layout(main.title = paste("KDE Q", i, "(", floor((i-1)/4 + 2021), "Q", (i-1)%% 4 + 1, ")"),
                main.title.size = 0.8,
                legend.outside = TRUE,
                legend.outside.position = "right")
    
    plot_list[[i - start_quarter + 1]] <- tm
  }
  
  # Arrange plots in a row
  tmap_arrange(plot_list, ncol = 3)
}

# Usage
tmap_mode("plot")
plot_kde_quarters_tmap(kde, start_quarter = 1)
```

```{r}
plot_kde_quarters_tmap(kde, start_quarter = 4)
```

```{r}
plot_kde_quarters_tmap(kde, start_quarter = 7)
```

```{r}
plot_kde_quarters_tmap(kde, start_quarter = 10)
```

This chunk is broken for now but should be fixed later :')

```{r}

# Usage for static plots
# tmap_mode("plot")
# plot_stkde_quarters(st_kde, start_quarter = 1)

# Usage for animation
# plot_stkde_quarters(st_kde, animate = TRUE)
```

# Bonus section: Network analysis

I'm starting this analysis to understand the complex dynamics of the Myanmar conflict, particularly focusing on Operation 1027 which began in October 2023. By looking at Q4 (which I assume is represented by QuarterNumeric == 12 in our data), I can capture the initial phase and immediate aftermath of this operation.

I'm using network analysis because conflicts often involve multiple actors with complex relationships. This method can help me visualize and quantify these relationships.

```{r}
# Filter data for Quarter 12
acled_q12 <- acled_filtered %>%
  filter(QuarterNumeric == 12)

```

We first filter by Q12 (2023 Q4) to first look at Operation 1027 data.

```{r}
# 1. Network Graph of Actor Interactions

edge_list <- acled_q12 %>%
  select(actor1, actor2) %>%
  filter(actor1 != "", actor2 != "") %>%
  group_by(actor1, actor2) %>%
  summarise(weight = n(), .groups = "drop")

```

This step is about identifying interactions between actors. Each time two actors are involved in an event, it's counted as an interaction. The 'weight' tells me how often these actors interacted.

In the context of Operation 1027, this could reveal new alliances or intensified conflicts between certain groups. For example, I might see increased interactions between the Three Brotherhood Alliance (who initiated Operation 1027) and the Myanmar military.

# Network Graph of Actor Interactions

Now that we have our edge list, let's create a pruned actor graph!

First, let's make a directed graph from an edge list. In the context of conflict analysis, this represents interactions between actors, where the direction matters (e.g., who initiated an action against whom). Then, we'll calculate the out-degree for each node (actor), which represents the number of actions initiated by each actor and select the top 10. This is crucial because:

-   It identifies the most active conflict initiators

-   It allows us to focus on key players, simplifying a potentially complex network

-   It provides a quantitative measure of each actor's role in driving the conflict

Lastly, we'll create a subgraph with those 10, to focus on their relationships and patterns.

```{r}
# Create graph
g <- graph_from_data_frame(edge_list, directed = TRUE)

```

Great! Let's print out our plot out right now.

```{r}
# Print the plot
print(p_network)
```

```{r}
# Summary of top initiators
cat("Top 10 Initiators in Myanmar Conflict (October):\n")
print(node_metrics)

```

As we can see, the center of the visualization is the Brotherhood Alliance, represented by the largest node, indicating its role as the primary initiator of conflict events during this period. This aligns with reports of the Alliance spearheading a coordinated offensive against the military government.

Interesting, key ethnic armed organizations such as the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA) and Kachin Independence Organization/Army (KIO/KIA) are prominently featured, highlighting the operation's broad ethnic base. Their connections to the Brotherhood Alliance node visually represent the unprecedented level of coordination among these groups during the offensive.

The presence of nodes like "Unidentified Anti-Coup Armed Group" and "GZP-Mandalay" (Generation Z Power) also suggest involvement from pro-democracy forces and local resistance groups, indicating the diverse coalition that Operation 1027 has roped in to fight against the military.

Lastly, varying thicknesses of connecting lines between nodes depict the frequency of interactions. Notably, the thicker lines between the Brotherhood Alliance and other major groups corroborate reports of enhanced coordination, a factor that contributed to the operation's initial success and the significant territorial gains made by resistance forces.

# Conclusions

Let's quickly sum up some takeaways we've had from this:

1.  Kernel Density Estimation (KDE): We used KDE to visualize the spatial intensity of conflict events across Myanmar. This method helped identify hotspots of conflict activity, revealing areas with higher concentrations of incidents. KDE provided a smoothed representation of event density, allowing us to discern broad patterns in the geographical distribution of conflicts.

2.  Spatiotemporal KDE: By incorporating the temporal dimension into our KDE analysis, we examined how conflict hotspots evolved over time. This approach revealed the dynamic nature of the conflict, showing how areas of intense activity shifted or persisted across different periods. Spatiotemporal KDE helped us understand the conflict's progression and identify potential seasonal or cyclical patterns in violence.

3.  Second-order functions (L and G functions): These functions allowed us to analyze the spatial dependence and clustering of conflict events:

4.  The G function focused on nearest neighbor distances, providing insights into local, small-scale patterns.

5.  The L function examined spatial relationships across multiple scales, revealing broader clustering patterns.

The combination of these functions showed that while conflicts might appear randomly distributed at very local scales, they exhibit significant clustering at larger scales. This suggests the presence of underlying factors influencing conflict distribution beyond immediate event-to-event interactions.

Network graphs for top 10 actors:

We constructed network graphs to visualize the relationships and interactions among the top 10 actors involved in the conflict. This approach helped us understand the complex web of alliances, confrontations, and power dynamics driving the conflict. By identifying key players and their connections, we gained insights into the conflict's structure and potential points of influence or intervention.

By combining these analytical methods, we developed a comprehensive understanding of the Myanmar conflict:

-   Spatial patterns: We identified key conflict hotspots and their evolution over time, providing a geographical context to the violence.

-   Multi-scale dynamics: Our analysis revealed how local randomness in event locations exists within larger-scale clustering, pointing to broader environmental or socio-political factors influencing conflict distribution.

-   Temporal trends: Spatiotemporal analysis helped us track the conflict's progression and identify any cyclical patterns or significant shifts in activity.

-   Actor relationships: Network analysis of key players provided insights into the conflict's human dimension, highlighting important relationships and power structures.

Through this, I hope you've learnt along with me how R and geospatial analysis can really help deepen our understanding of such dire events like these, and gain a better more nuanced standpoint on what's going on beyond what's presented in the news, with potential for a complex and deep understanding on the groups to target/help to hopefully put to an end to such a tragic conflict for Myanmar and her people.
